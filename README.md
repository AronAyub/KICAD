# KICAD

kicad design projects
In this repository I have provided my previous KICAD PCB Designs for:
### Arduino hat
- this is a complete arduino hat, check the folder for files! it is among my first designs

### Breadboard - Power Supply
- most devs use breadborad for their prototyping, learn how to create a breadboard power supply. it is among my first designs

### Flamingo Control Board
- this was a client project, he allowed to have it open source. He is from Florida! funny enough he wanted a Flamingo shapped PCB, it is among my first designs

### 12V 1A input to 3v3 /5V circuit 

- this is a simple power supply unit which accepts 12V, 1A and gives, 3V3 and 5V as output, it is among my first designs
